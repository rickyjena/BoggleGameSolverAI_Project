Usage
This program is just a starter for an Ai I am creating that will play boggle
successfully.So basically this program will has a a total of 6 functions. This
program takes in a boggle board through a .txt file and has multiple functions
that show the basic capabilities of playing boggle. So inorder for (part1) of
this project to work. You will need the interpreter.py program. The syntax you
must use to run it in a terminal is:
"python interpreter.py boggleSolverAIMain.py"
Once this command is run it will run a test for all the functions that are
stored in the file boggleSolverAI.py. 
Make sure you have the following files in the same directory:
-boggleSolverAIMain.py
-fourboard3.txt(or maybe your own board file)
-boggleSolverAI.py
-interpreter.py
-twl06.txt(Your own dictionary of any prefered language maybe)
